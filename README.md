# The Surfing Project

A static web page for "The Surfing Project", an imaginary surf school in peer-learning that sells surf trips, modified from the initial exercice of THP: https://suziwan.github.io/The_Surfing_Project/  

The languages and tools used are HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.  

PS: It shows only a landing page, the links and buttons do not work.
